Which repository setup will we use?
Monorepo. 

Which branching model will we use?
Feature branches. 

Development branches are created for each feature. 
Protected main branch with pull requests (1 approval needed).

Which distributed development workflow will we use?
Github issues and Github project (which acts as a kanban board). 

What do we expect contributions to look like?
PRâ€™s to the main branch - one of the group members has to approve. We have set up rules that require 1 approval to merge and not allow pushing directly to the main branch.  

Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
Everyone in the team is responsible for reviewing changes. Integration is done using CI pipelines.
